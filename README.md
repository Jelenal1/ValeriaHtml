# Valeria Muster Website

## Technologies
As a developer, I have created the website using HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript to comply with the latest standards for web design and development.

## Design
I designed the website from scratch without using any AI assistant or third-party design tools. My focus was on providing a clear, intuitive user experience and an aesthetically appealing layout.

## Responsive Design
The website has been designed to be responsive, ensuring optimal display on a variety of devices. Whether it's a desktop, tablet, or smartphone, users will have a pleasant browsing experience.

## Firebase
Firebase was used as the backend service for the website. Firebase offers a range of services, including real-time database, user authentication, and hosting. By leveraging Firebase for aspects such as security and performance, I was able to concentrate on building the actual web application.

## Blog
The blog feature is a central component of the website. It includes both a user view and an admin view, with the latter accessible only to authorized individuals. I have developed the functionalities to add, edit, and delete posts. These features have been implemented entirely using Vanilla JavaScript.

## Administration Page
The administration page provides extensive functionalities for managing the website and blog. Only authorized individuals have access to this area and can create new blog posts, edit or delete existing posts, and manage users.

# Conclusion
With "ValeriaHtml," I have created a compelling and effective platform for the candidate. The combination of an intuitive, appealing design, the benefits of Firebase, and the extensive features of the administration page make the website a valuable tool for the election campaign.
